The city is easily accessible by road and is a popular destination for both tourists and locals alike, offering a range of activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and exploring local markets and shops.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about Khemisset or any other topic?

    "content": "Sure, I can help with that! We'll show that if 2n+1 divides n^2+2, then n must be even.\n\nSuppose for the sake of contradiction that n is odd. Then we can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Now, we have\n\nn^2 + 2 = (2k + 1)^2 + 2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 3 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1) + 1.\n\nBut then 2n+1 = 2(2k + 1) + 1, so we see that 2n+1 divides n^2 + 2 if and only if it divides 1. However, since 2n+1 > 1, this is a contradiction. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

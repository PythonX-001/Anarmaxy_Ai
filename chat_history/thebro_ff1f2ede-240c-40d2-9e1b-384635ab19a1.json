Here's a basic recipe for a classic sponge cake:\n\nIngredients:\n1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened\n2 large eggs\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour\n1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 cup (120ml) milk\nInstructions:\nPreheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.\n\nCream Butter and Sugar: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.\n\nAdd Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.\n\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.\n\nMix Wet and Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake tough.\n\nBake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\nCool and Frost: Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.\n\nFrosting: You can frost your cake with your favorite frosting, such as buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or chocolate ganache. Get creative with decorations, fruit, or sprinkles!\n\nEnjoy your homemade cake! Feel free to experiment with different flavors and decorations to make it your own. \""
